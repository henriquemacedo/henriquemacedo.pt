## üßê I want to look

1. **Navigate into henriquemacedo.pt directory and start it up.**

   ```sh
   cd henriquemacedo.pt/
   gatsby develop
   ```

2. **Open the source code and start exploring!**

   The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying the data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

   Open the `henriquemacedo.pt` directory in your code editor of choice and start from `src/pages/index.js`.
